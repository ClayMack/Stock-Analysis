# Stock Analysis using VBA and EXCEL

## Overview of weekly challenge project

## Purpose

This project's scope was to analyze stock market data using VBA macros to sum total daily volumes and annual returns for each stock ticker. The challenge was to refractored the macro in order to make it run faster. 


## Original Project Details:

Steve wants to help his parents analyze stock to find investment opportunities. To help him we need to find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
